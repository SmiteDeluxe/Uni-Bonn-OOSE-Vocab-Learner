\section{Project organization and testing}
As a starting point, the main Scene and Controller handling server selection and user login, as well as the functionality to set and switch between scenes was implemented. \\
On the top of these fundamental construct, the login screen was adapted from the previous exercises was adapted and the rest of the application function was split between the 3 main screens ("Vocabulary", "Learning", and "Goals") and style and design was added by extending the .css file and adding icons, designs etc. \\
In each developmental area a GUI implementing the required features was designed and the required internal data-structures, interfaces between screens, and API communication were determined and implemented as needed. \\
The generated code was manually tested by the specified use-cases.

\section{Project Responsibilities and Contributions}

The project was split amongst the frames within in the application. Responsibilities were distributed as following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item *** was responsible for %  ~53 punkte
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Setting up \textit{Main} class and providing function to change scenes
        \item Registration frame: Login and register screen (adapted from previous exercise assignments), server selection and connection, waiting animation, Remember-me function, and password encryption
        \item Application design: Usage of css file and addition of the icons, with the structure and design of MainScene containing the NavigationBar and TitleBar
        \item API calls (used for Vocabulary learning and management)
    \end{itemize}
\item *** was responsible for % ~27 punkte
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Vocabulary learning: Learning core functionality and string operations like checking the users answer for mistakes
    \end{itemize}
\item *** was responsible for % ~33 punkte
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Vocabulary management: Accessing, adding, searching, editing, and deleting Vocabulary entries
    \end{itemize}
\item *** was responsible for: % ~21 punkte 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Setting up Gradle project and gitignore
        \item Selection of vocabulary to learn ("Goals"): Selecting vocabulary to learn and filter by language - the code for the vocabulary \textit{TableView} with check-boxes (\textit{VocabSelection} class and state accessing logic) was re-used for vocabulary management
        \item Documentation
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Usage of FXML and the respective controllers, internationalization, and asynchronous API calls were realized by each developer individually. \\
Remaining jointly used functionality, especially, the \textit{Variables} class used for inter-screen communication was developed jointly.
